## Summary
1. Most users will ride for 30 minutes or less between 7:00AM to 7:00PM
2. Males are have the highest subscrition rate.
3. Bike Repairs need to be done during non-peak hours around 1-5 am.

## Additional Analysis
1. Average Trip Duration By Customer Type

This would be beneficial to see if there is a difference to the trip duration for subscribers and average customers. It would be helpful to see if one customer type uses it longer and for how much longer. This would be helpful to see how many bikes we would need to have available.

2. Top Starting and Ending Locations

This would be beneficial to ensure there are enough bikes for users at the peak areas in Des Moines.
